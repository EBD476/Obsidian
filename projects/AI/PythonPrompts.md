Generate zip file with rules in python :
```txt
Prompt:
I have 400 text files in a directory named "text files'. The files are named like -TG,STAID000001.txt"."TG_STAID000002.txr. and so on. I want to place files "TG_STAID000001.txt to -TG_STA10000010.txt- in one separate ZIP file. -TGSTAID000011txt- to "TG.STAID000020.td" in another separate ZIP file, and so on Write me a Python script for that 

solve problem:
You created the ZIP files in batches of 10 files. You didn't look at the filenames. The filenames have a number before the .txt extension. The number is important. Files with numbers 1 to 10 should be inside a ZIP file. Numbers 11 to 20 should be inside another zip file. So, the number before the .txt extension is very important. Rewrite the Python script.
